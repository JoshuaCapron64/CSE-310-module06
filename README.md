# Overview

Through this program, I had hoped to revisit a project that I had done before during my earlier days of learning programming, but instead reimagine it with more advanced techniques and applying the things I had learned ever since the completion of that original project. Completing this the way I have has shown me that I am a much more competent and able programmer than I had initially thought. I believe I only needed to look something up once, and I was able to complete the rest basically on my own. Not only that, but all files for the original project I had done were lost or deleted over the years, so I had to start this one over from scratch. Nonetheless, I proved my skills as a programmer with this one.

# Development Environment

This software required nothing more than Visual Studio Code, the Python language, and the basic Python extensions such as Pylance, and Python, both released by Microsoft.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

- Find new uses for the variable that uses the player's name (maybe rewrite the narrative in the third person?)
- Include more choices.
- Include options that can be executed at any time during the game, such as pulling up the things to keep in mind, or quitting the game altogether.
